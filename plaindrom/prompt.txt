Create a function that processes an array of strings and returns an array where each string is modified so that it becomes a palindrome. If a string cannot be rearranged to form a palindrome, it should remain unchanged.

A string can be rearranged into a palindrome if at most one character has an odd frequency. This is because, in a palindrome, characters appear symmetrically, except for the middle character in the case of an odd-length palindrome.
