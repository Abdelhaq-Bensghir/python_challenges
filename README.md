# python_challenges
Welcome to the python_challenges repository! This collection is designed to help you enhance your Python programming skills through a series of engaging and thought-provoking challenges. 

## Objective

For each challenge, our objective is to provide two versions of the solution:

1. **Functional Programming Version**: A solution that utilizes Python's functional programming paradigms, focusing on functions, immutability, and declarative style.
2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Version**: A solution that uses Python's OOP paradigms, focusing on classes, objects, and encapsulation.

We will also include a comparison to highlight the differences, advantages, and use cases for each approach.

## How to Use

Each challenge is presented with a description, followed by the functional and OOP versions of the solution. You can explore the solutions and compare them to understand different programming paradigms and enhance your problem-solving skills.

## Contribution
